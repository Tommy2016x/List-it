# List-it
A very simple web app that my team and I made for mangohacks 2018

This was my first hackathon and I didn't really know alot going into it. This was also my first go at web development as I made the front-end learning how HTML and CSS with Bootstrap throughout the event. I also learned about git and version control as well.
